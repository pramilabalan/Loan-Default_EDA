# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
## Identifying the factors responsible for loan defaults

This case study aims to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, that is, the variables which are strong indicators of default.  

The dataset is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/rattlebones/bank-loans-dataset

### Business Objective

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, and so on. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

### Data Understanding
This dataset has 3 files: 

1. `application_data.csv`  contains all the information of the client at the time of application.
The data is about whether a client has payment difficulties.


2. `previous_application.csv` contains information about the client’s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.


3. `columns_description.csv` is data dictionary which describes the meaning of the variables.


#### The overall approach of the analysis is in the presentation file.
